# Bookshelf Website (MERN Stack)

Simple bookshelf and loaned books tracker implemented using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.

## Features

- Add and delete books from your bookshelf (store title, author, description, and rating)
- Sort bookshelf by date added, rating, or alphabetically by title/author
- (Buggy) Track loaned books to friends on "Manage Loans" page

## Bugs

- Using "loan" button changes display order
- Using "mark as returned" button changes display order and needs reload to update

## How to Run

Run `npm run dev` in `backend` and `npm start` in `frontend`. If `npm start` does not redirect you, open http://localhost:3000.
